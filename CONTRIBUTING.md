## Getting Started ðŸš€

To get started with development, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine (choose HTTPS or SSH):
    - **HTTPS** (recommended for most users):
      ```bash
      git clone https://github.com/erupsi/erupsi-erd.git
      cd erupsi-erd
      ```
    - **SSH** (if you have set up SSH keys with GitHub):
      ```bash
      git clone git@github.com:erupsi/erupsi-erd.git
      cd erupsi-erd
      ```
2. Install dependencies for both the frontend and backend:
   ```bash
   # TODO: Add actual dependency installation commands for frontend and backend
   # <your-install-commands-here>
   ```

## Coding Guidelines ðŸ› 

To ensure code quality, maintainability, and consistency across the project, please follow these guidelines when
contributing:

### General Guidelines ðŸ“œ

- Use [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) and [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for code formatting and linting. See the
  `.prettierrc` and `.eslintrc.js` files to learn the rules, and see [Prettier](https://prettier.io/docs/index.html)
  and [ESLint](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/configure/) docs.
- Use [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/utility-first) utility classes for styling in React components.
- Keep services modular and loosely coupled.
- Use environment variables for configuration (`.env`).
- Document API changes in `/contracts`.
- Use clear, descriptive names for variables, functions, and components (`startTime`, `employeeId`, etc).
- Follow the existing folder structure and naming conventions.

### Branching & Commits ðŸ”€

- Use feature branches for new features or bug fixes:
    - Branch names should be descriptive, e.g., `feature/user-authentication`, `bugfix/inventory-update`.
- Write clear, descriptive commit messages. Follow
  the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) standard if applicable:
    - Use `feat:` for new features.
    - Use `fix:` for bug fixes.
    - Use `docs:` for documentation changes.
    - Use `style:` for changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, etc.).
    - Use `refactor:` for code changes that neither fix a bug nor add a feature.
    - Use `test:` for adding missing tests or correcting existing tests.

### Testing & Linting ðŸ§ª

- Each service should have its own test under `/tests`.
- Make sure all tests pass and lint errors are fixed before pushing:
  ```bash
  npm run test
  npm run lint
  ```

### Pull Request Checklist âœ…

- [ ] PR has a clear title and description.
- [ ] Docs and contracts are updated if applicable.
- [ ] All new features are covered by tests.
- [ ] All tests pass and linting is clean.
- [ ] No console logs or commented-out code.

## How to Contribute ðŸ’»

If you want to propose changes but don't have write access to the repository, you can still contribute by following
these steps:

1. [Fork](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo#forking-a-repository)
   the `erupsi/erupsi-erd` repository.
2. Clone your fork to your local machine using the same commands as [above](#getting-started-), but make sure you clone
   the forked repository instead the original one:
    ```bash
    # Original repository
    erupsi/erupsi-erd
   
    # Your forked repository
    your-username/your-forked-repo-name
   ```
3. Checkout a new branch to start working on your changes:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```
4. Make your changes and commit them:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "type: brief description of your changes"
   ```
5. Push your branch to your fork:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```
6. Open a Pull Request (PR) to the upstream repository.
7. Participate in code review and address any requested changes.

## Need help or have ideas? ðŸ’¡

- Use the GitHub Issues tab to report bugs or request features.
- Check the existing issues first:
    - If your issue is there, add a comment with any additional information or up-vote.
    - If your issue is not listed, create a new issue.
        - Use a clear title and description.
        - Label the issue appropriately (bug, feature request, etc.).
        - Provide as much detail as possible, including steps to reproduce, expected behavior, and screenshots if
          relevant.
