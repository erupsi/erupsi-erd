     git clone git@github.com:erupsi/erupsi-erd.git

   # TODO: Add actual dependency installation commands for frontend and backend
   # Example:

   # cd ../backend && npm install
   ```

## Coding Guidelines
- Use [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) and [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for code formatting and linting.

- Write clear, descriptive commit messages.
- Follow the existing folder structure and naming conventions.
- Add/update tests where appropriate.
