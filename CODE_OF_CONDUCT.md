Welcome to the Erupsi project!\
We’re building this to learn, grow, and contribute to something useful — together.

To ensure a safe and respectful space for everyone, we ask all contributors to follow this Code of Conduct.

## 💬 Our Pledge

We, as contributors and maintainers, pledge to make participation in our project and community a harassment-free experience for everyone.

## 🤝 Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism

* Showing empathy toward other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others’ private information without explicit permission
* Deliberate intimidation or exclusion
* Repeated disruptive behavior

## 📢 Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

They have the right to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that do not align with this Code of Conduct.
